## CosmereWiki

The un-creatively named "CosmereWiki" is unsurprisingly a wiki made for the Cosmere universe. This serves as a personal wiki for me to refer to so I can easily access information about certain terms, events, people, etc. without having to dig through the thousands of pages for the info. 

Although wikis such as Coppermind does exist, I do not want to see any sort of spoilers, especially as I am new to the Cosmere universe and the books within it. As such, this is a living wiki as I will continuously update the wiki for myself as I continue reading.

I have not received permission to use artwork from the books and as such, this wiki will just be hopefully decently formatted and somewhat easy to navigate walls of text. 

## Books Read so Far

This list of books represents how much I have read and as such, how much information is in here. Although a book may appear in this list, it does not necessarily mean I have added all the info from that book into this wiki. I am prone to mistakes and overlooking certain details though I will try my best to be diligent and not skip over any major characters, dates, locations, and events.

**Stormlight Archive:**
1. The Way of Kings
2. Words of Radiance
3. Edgedancer
4. Oathbringer
5. Dawnshard
6. Rhythm of War

**Mistborn Trilogy (Era 1):**
1. The Final Empire

## Why Re-Invent the Wheel?

The main reason is spoilers. I do not intend nor am I crazy enough to even think about competing or contesting against Coppermind or any of the other great wikis out there. This is just for myself since I am not particularly the type of person to take written notes or highlight things (I would highlight entire paragraphs at this rate). If you are looking for a comprehensive wiki, please consider the Coppermind wiki.

## Installation and Execution

Please ensure you have Python installed. I personally am using Python 3.10, but I believe that any newer version should still be compatible (in case you already have a version installed). For now, the only external library that I use are `PyQt5` and `pyqt5-tools`, which can simply be installed with `pip install PyQt5` and `pip install pyqt5-tools` respectively. I do not use any custom fonts, so the base library installs for those two should be sufficient.

To execute, simply run `main.py`!

## Got Questions or Remarks?

This program also serves as a way for me to showcase my coding and my flexibility in terms of libraries used. This is my first formal project using PyQt5, so I will appreciate any advice or suggestions you may have. I code as a hobby, but I do try to stick to best practices whenever possible, so I am happy to learn whenever I can! For any sort of questions, remarks, suggestions, etc., please email me at anthony.ha.pham@tamu.edu!
