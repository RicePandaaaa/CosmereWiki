## CosmereWiki

The un-creatively named "CosmereWiki" is unsurprisingly a wiki made for the Cosmere universe. This serves as a personal wiki for me to refer to so I can easily access information about certain terms, events, people, etc. without having to dig through the thousands of pages for the info. 

Although wikis such as Coppermind does exist, I do not want to see any sort of spoilers, especially as I am new to the Cosmere universe and the books within it. As such, this is a living wiki as I will continuously update the wiki for myself as I continue reading.

I have not received permission to use artwork from the books and as such, this wiki will just be hopefully decently formatted and somewhat easy to navigate walls of text. 

## Books Read so Far

This list of books represents how much I have read and as such, how much information is in here. Although a book may appear in this list, it does not necessarily mean I have added all the info from that book into this wiki. I am prone to mistakes and overlooking certain details though I will try my best to be diligent and not skip over any major characters, dates, locations, and events.
