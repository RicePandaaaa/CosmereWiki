    "notes:": "Duralumin has been used several times throughout the Mistborn series (both eras) to enhance an Allomantic ability, notably Pushes, at least from what I can remember. Interestingly, duralumin can be used to store Connection with the cost being loss of friendship and trust. However, tapping into this allows very quick formation of relationships. I suppose that people's actions and intents can be enhanced through friendship and human bond, so this makes sense to me personally but perhaps is just a coincidence.\n\nDuralumin in real life is an aluminum alloy often used in the aviation industry. How this relates to duralumin in universe is unknown to me. Perhaps Sanderson liked the name.",
