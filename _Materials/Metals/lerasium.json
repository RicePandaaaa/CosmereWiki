    "notes:": "Lerasium grants the power to become a Mistborn (access to all Allomantic abilities). There doesn't seem to be more details of how Lerasium works exactly. Stealing all abilities does seem to be a vague description of what a Lerasium spike does however. I know that Hemalurgy loses power during the transferring process, so does this mean that the spike transfers just a bit of everything? So essentially one would be a mini Mistborn?",
