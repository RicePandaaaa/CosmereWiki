    "notes:": "Leechers typically require physical touch to actually destroy the allomantic reservers (although the range can be extended by other means such a very special cube). Fortune explicitly can be stored to be tapped into as a luck source, but I am curious how lucky you can be. To an extent, could you theoretically force a future by tapping enough fortune? Also stealing destiny is interesting especially as this is not even guarenteed (highlighted by the\"might\").",
