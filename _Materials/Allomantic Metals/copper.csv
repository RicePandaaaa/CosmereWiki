usages|Hides Allomantic pulses (allomancy)
description|In allomancy, copper is an internal, mental, pulling metal. Burning copper creates an invisible cloud of copper that prevents detection of allomancy, even against Seekers or someone burning bronze. However, this is not foolproof: a sufficiently powerful entity can still pierce through this coppercloud. This copper cloud is not specific to the user and can be extended to other allomancers. The metal pairing is bronze.
